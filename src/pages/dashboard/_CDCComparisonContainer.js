      <h4>Differences between this data and the CDC data</h4>
      <p>
        As of today, the C.D.C. has tested 133,442 specimens, and we have
        tracked at least 2,054,462 tests administered across the country. It is
        important to note that testing numbers are likely an undercount because
        of the lack of universal testing and state reporting, and that multiple
        specimen tests can be conducted from a single personâ€™s sample.
