**Cumulative record of our daily totals. Each day's total is *generally* as of 4pm ET that day, so data that comes in from states after that cut-off will usually show in the *next* day's total. We do make occasional exceptions and delay our official release if it appears that a large state report is about to come in just after 4pm.**
