This page is populated with **cumulative daily totals** from [our big spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#). The information is what we have at 4pm ET each day, so data that comes in from the states after that cutoff will show in the next day's total. We also have [an API you might like](https://covidtracking.com/api/). You can also [learn how this project works](https://covidtracking.com/about-tracker/) and [dig into the crunchy details of the dataset and the spreadsheet](https://covidtracking.com/newsroom-expert-faq/).
