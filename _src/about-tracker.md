summary: >
  This project is made by hand. We use technical tools to alert us to changes in
  the information states report, but all the information we publish has been
  collected and double-checked by humans. We prize accuracy over speed while
  also trying to keep the data fresh.

We update the full dataset each day between 4pm and 5pm EDT and do additional updates throughout the day as new information arrives.

## Where do you get your data?

All our information comes from state/district/territory public health authorities—or, occasionally, from trusted news reporting, official press conferences, or (very occasionally) tweets or Facebook updates from state public health authorities or governors. We cite all sources in the spreadsheet and discuss the dataset’s constantly fluctuating oddities in the annotations that accompany each state’s data on [our site](https://covidtracking.com/data/) and [in the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#).

## How trustworthy are your numbers?

We get the bulk of our data directly from state public health authorities, so we’re as reliable as they are, though we don’t have a live feed, so our numbers can be a few hours behind. States, however, report their numbers in inconsistent ways, which makes working with this dataset a bit complicated. Some states, like Oregon, provide the full set of numbers we track: thetotal number of tests conducted, breaking outpositive,negative, andpendingtests. For these states, we can provide data stretching through time, so they are maximally useful.

Other states provide some or none of these numbers on an ongoing basis. Some crucial states in this outbreak, notably California, Washington, and New York, have not been regularly reporting their total number of people tested. For these, we have to use other reporting tools: directly asking state officials, watching news conferences, gleaning information from trusted news sources, and whatever else it takes to present reliable numbers. Our hope is that all the states will begin providing comprehensive statistics, includingnegativesandtotalsfrom commercial and university labs.

## What if the CDC starts releasing this information?

That would be great! They have started providing some information about testing capacity by sample, but they’re still not reporting people tested or test results. If they do start publishing full data, we’ll keep our effort going for a while to make sure the data matches up, and then publicly archive our work for reference.

## If I cite numbers from this site, how should I credit the source?

## Do you have an API?

[Right here.](/api)

## But I want to know literally everything about your dataset and spreadsheet

Great! We made an [FAQ for newsrooms](https://covidtracking.com/newsroom-expert-faq/) and other organizations who want to work with the data, dive right in.
